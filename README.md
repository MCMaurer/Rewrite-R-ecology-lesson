# Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson

This is the lesson repository for Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson.

This is a version of https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson-intermediate. The lesson was originally developed as a repo in my GitHub, and I've kept a version here for backwards-compatibility since I gave quite a few people the link to my site. 

At some point I may just set it up as a redirect to the Incubator and eventually the DC lesson.
